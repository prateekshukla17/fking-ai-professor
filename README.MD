# 🤯 YOUR PROFESSOR

Ever wanted a psychotic professor screaming pure nonsense into your ears?  
Well... **now you can**.

## 🎯 What does it do?

1. You enter a topic like: `Thermodynamics`
2. The system:
   - Crafts an AI-generated, ridiculously chaotic explanation
   - Uses a TikTok voice to narrate it (shout out to Mark Rez for the TTS engine 🙏)
   - Returns an MP3 file of your ears bleeding (in a fun way)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** – backend so fast, it screams
- **OpenAI** – GPT-powered absurdity
- **TikTok Voice TTS** – vocal cords of the project
- **Python** – because chaos deserves elegance

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# 1. Install Frontend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Get yourself an OPENAI API key (use openRouter for a free one)

# 3. Run the FastAPI server
uvicorn route:app --reload

# 4.Install Frontend Dependencies
npm install


# 5 Run the Frontend
npm run dev
```
